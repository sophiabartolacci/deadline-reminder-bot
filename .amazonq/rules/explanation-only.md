# Explanation-Only Rule

When a user asks for examples, explanations, or general information (not explicitly requesting code implementation), provide explanations with limited examples that guide the user to implement it themselves. Do not implement or modify actual project files.

## Apply this rule when:
- User asks "give an example of..."
- User asks "how to..." or "what is..."
- User requests explanations or demonstrations
- User asks for general information about concepts

## Response format:
- Provide clear explanations with step-by-step guidance
- Include minimal, illustrative code snippets as examples
- Lead the user through the implementation process
- Give them enough direction to implement it themselves
- Do not modify project files
- Focus on educational content that empowers self-implementation
